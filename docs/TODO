What will be next?
------------------
Well, surely there are already some plans. These include:

 - include support for Darwin (Mac)
   already got testoutput here waiting to be worked through
   thanks go to Christian Stocker for providing the output
 - check and add support for other plattforms except Linus and Windows
 - perform more plattform-testing
  

If you would like to help working on any of these ideas or have more good ideas to
add to our list, simply leave me a message.
